Assume that a few days have passed and the SLO is still in the ALERT status, indicating that some action is needed to remedy the situation. 

Letâ€™s explore the data in Datadog for the Spree::HomeController#index resource to try and find the source of the problem.
1. Navigate to <a href="https://app.datadoghq.com/apm/resource/storefrontend/rack.request/69d105fa043dba7f" target="_datadog">**APM** > **Services** > **storefrontend** > **Spree::HomeController#index** in Datadog</a>.
3. Wait for about 2 minutes for the data to come in. You may need to refresh the page. 
4. Notice that the graph for **Total Requests** and **Total Errors** are now only receiveing error data, indicated by red bars. 
3. Expand the graphs for **Total Requests** and **Total Errors**. 
4. In the expanded **Total Errors** graph, hover over the red bar. You will see the *http.status_code:500* message for the errors.

5. Close the expanded graph and scroll down to the **Trace** list.
6. Click any trace with a **500** status.
7. Notice that the spans **rack.request Spree::HomeController#index** and **rails.action_controller Spree::HomeController#index** have errors.
8. Click the **rack.request Spree::HomeController#index** span, and then click the **Errors** tab below the flame graph.
9. Notice that one of the errors indicates **SocketError: Failed to open TCP connection to advertisements:5002**, highlighted in red.
10. To the right of the flame graph, notice that the **advertisementsservice** is not listed.

Looks like the advertisement service is down!
