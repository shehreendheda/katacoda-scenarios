Letâ€™s disrupt a service in the app to see how the SLO Status and History are affected.

1. Click the **+** sign next to the **storedog** tab on the right and select **Open New Terminal**.
2. Click `disrupt`{{execute T3}} to disrupt the app service.
3. In <a href="https://app.datadoghq.com/slo" target="_datadog">**Monitor** > **Service Level Objectives** in Datadog</a>, click the SLO you created in the previous step.
4. Wait for about 2 minutes. Refresh the SLO view, if needed.

You should now see that the remaining error budget has decreased and may even be less than 0%, which means that SLO is now in the ALERT status.
