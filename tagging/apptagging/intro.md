With the various resources and services that support your applications, it is important to be able to correlate your data across Datadog for faster troubleshooting, targeted alerting, and overall smoother workflows.

In this activity, you will use tags assigned to a fictional e-commerce app, Storedog, to explore how tags link metrics, logs and traces data and to a create targeted alert.

The Storedog app is built using a Spree (Ruby on Rails) framework along with Flask (Python) microservices for handling coupon codes and ad services and is brought online using a docker container image.
