With the various resources and services that support your applications, it's important to be able to correlate your data across Datadog for faster troubleshooting, targeted alerting, and overall smoother workflows.

In this activity, you will use tags assigned to a fictional e-commerce app, Storedog, to explore correlated metric, log, and trace data and to a create targeted alert. You will also create synthetics tests to work with tags as a facet for filters. 

The Storedog app is built using a Spree (Ruby on Rails) framework along with Flask (Python) microservices for handling coupon codes and ad services and is brought online using docker container images.
