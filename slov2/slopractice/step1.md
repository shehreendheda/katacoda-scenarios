In the terminal on the right, the Storedog app is being instrumented for monitoring with Datadog. Live traffic to the app is also being simulated. This may take up to 2 minutes. Once the app is instrumented, you will see the following message in the terminal: `The environment is prepared!`

Let's make sure that the Storedog app is instrumented successfully and you are collecting data from the Storedog app in Datadog.

1. In a new browser window/tab, log in to the <a href="https://app.datadoghq.com/account/login" target="_datadog">Datadog account/organization</a> that was created for you by learn.datadoghq.com.

2. Navigate to <a href="https://app.datadoghq.com/apm/traces" target="_datadog">**APM** > **Traces**</a> in Datadog to view the list of traces that are being ingested for the Storedog app.
   
   If you are working in a new Datadog organization, the link will be redirected to the **APM** > **Introduction** page. You may need to wait about 2 minutes as Datadog's Autodiscovery feature detects the traces that are coming in. In the main menu, when the option appears, click the **APM > Traces** to see the list of traces.

3. Under **Facets**, expand **Env** and **Services**. 

   Make sure that `ruby-shop` is the only **Env** selected so that you are only viewing traces for the Storedog app.
   
   Make sure the **Services** shown below are listed. Click each to confirm that you are collecting live traces from them.

With Datadog collecting live app data from Storedog, let's start exploring the data to select SLIs for SLOs.
