Understanding the user experience in the app is an important step in the SLO creation process. Consider what users would do in the app and what critical user journeys should be reliable. 

For an e-commerce app like Storedog, users would reasonably expect to visit the home page, log in, search for items, view item details, manage items in their cart, and check out items for purchase.

Let's focus on two actions users will do: visi the storedog home page and manage items in their cart.

1. Click the **storedog** tab to the right. A new browser tab will open for Storedog app. 

2. Notice how long it takes the home page to load. 

   If the home took too long to load, users would not be happy with the app performance. So, an SLI for the latency for the home page can be the basis of an SLO for app performance.

3. Click 2 or 3 different products and add items to the cart.

   If users are unable to add items to a cart, one of the most important user actions in an e-commerce app, users will probably stop using the app. So, an SLI for a metric related to successfully adding items to the cart can be the basis of another SLO.

With the SLIs determined, let's create the SLOs.
