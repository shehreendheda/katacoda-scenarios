Log Rehydration^* allows you to recall log events from an Archive so that you can analyze and investigate them in Datadog. In <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/archives/rehydrating" target="_blank">Rehydrate from Archives</a>, you can create a <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/archives/rehydrating?tab=awss3#historical-views">Historical View</a> that defines the time period, Reload queries, Archive, number of logs, and retention period for the rehydrated logs. You can also set an optional notification so that you know when rehydration is complete. Once logs are rehydrated, you can <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/archives/rehydrating?tab=awss3#from-the-log-explorer">select the logs in the Log Explorer</a> under Historical Indexes in the Index facet.
