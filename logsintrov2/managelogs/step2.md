Because all your logs don’t have the same value and you don’t need access to all your logs at all times, Datadog decouples ingestion and indexing of logs. You can index logs that you want available in Datadog for monitoring and investigation. For long-term retention of all logs and logs that you don’t need immediate access to, you can set up <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/archives" target="_blank">Archives</a>. 

After logs are ingested and pass through configured processing pipelines, logs matching a search query can be sent to a cloud storage solution. If you need access to archived logs, you can <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/archives/rehydrating" target="_blank">Rehydrate from Archives</a>. Note: Archives can only be configured by users with admin permissions. Contact admin users on your team if you’re interested in using Archives.
