With Datadog's Logging without Limits\*, you can collect all your logs. But, not all of you logs are of equal value. You'll want some logs on hand at all times, while others can be archived and rehydrated when needed. Datadog has features for these areas of log management to help you create organized, cost-efficient logs workflows. Datadog also allows you to set role-based read access permissions for your log data.

This activity provides an overview of Indexes, Archives, Rehydrate from Archives, and Data Access in Logs Configuration.

When you start the activity, a fictional ecommerce app, Storedog, will be brought online in a Docker environment and instrumented with Datadog for data collection. The app has a Ruby store-frontend and Python discounts and advertisements services.
