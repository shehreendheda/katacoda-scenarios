Depending on the log data you are collecting in your Datadog organization and the different roles users have, you may want to set role-based read access for logs using <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/rbac/permissions/?tab=ui#log-management" target="_blank">Data Access</a>. Unrestricted access allows read access to all logs, while No Access blocks read access to all logs. Restricted access grants read access to a specified subset of logs. You can build restriction queries using log search syntax to filter the subset logs that different roles/users will be able to view.
