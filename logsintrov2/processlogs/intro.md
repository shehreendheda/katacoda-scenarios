After you start collecting logs, you need to process them so that they have the same format, structure, and attribute naming convention. Datadog has log configuration features that you can use to automatically process logs from common logs sources as well as features that you can use to set up custom processing of logs.

This activity provides an overview of Pipelines, Processors, and Standard Attributes in Logs Configuration.

When you start the activity, a fictional ecommerce app, Storedog, will be brought online in a Docker environment and instrumented with Datadog for data collection. The app has a Ruby store-frontend and Python discounts and advertisements services.
