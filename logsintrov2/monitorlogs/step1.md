In <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/dashboards/" target="_blank">Dashboards</a>, you can graph <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/dashboards/screenboards/" target="_blank">Log Events</a> in <href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/dashboards/widgets/timeseries/" target="_blank">Timeseries</a> widgets to display the evolution of these events over time.

You can also add the <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/logs_to_metrics/" target="_blank">Log Stream Widget</a> to <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/dashboards/screenboards/" target="_blank">Screenboards</a> to display a live view of a subset of logs (filtered using the log search syntax) alongside related data in the Screenboard.

Let's create a screenboard with these widgets.

1. In a new browser window/tab, use the login credentials provided in the terminal to log in to the <a href="https://app.datadoghq.com/account/login" target="_datadog">Datadog account/organization</a> that was created for you for this activity.

    Note: If the credentials are not displayed in the terminal, run the command `creds`{{execute}} in the terminal.

2. Navigate to <a href="https://app.datadoghq.com/logs" target="_datadog">**Logs**</a>.
