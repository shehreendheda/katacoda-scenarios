<a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/explorer/#transactions" target="_blank">Transaction</a> queries allow you to aggregate related log events into a single higher-level “transaction” event using a tag or an attribute from the logs. For each transaction event, the tag/attribute value and corresponding transaction duration, max severity, and event count are displayed. With transaction queries, you can better visualize complex interconnected systems through log events, identify transaction bottlenecks by comparing durations, event counts, and custom measures, and reduce MTTD by isolating transactions with errors or high latencies.

Transactions aggregate indexed logs according to instances of a sequence of events, such as a user session or a request processed across multiple micro-services.
