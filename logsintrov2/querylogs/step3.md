Organizing large volumes of logs from different sources can be cumbersome. However, logs from a source usually have specific patterns. The <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/explorer/#patterns" target="_blank">Patterns</a> aggregation can be surfaced automatically in the Log Explorer and are listed by number of logs with a service name, log status, and log message that matches a certain pattern. You can filter the list using search syntax and facets to focus on patterns you’re interested in. And, you can click a pattern from the list to view log samples matching the pattern and even the pattern’s parsing rule. 

With pattern aggregation, logs that have a message with similar structures, belong to the same service and have the same status are grouped altogether. The patterns view is helpful for detecting and filtering noisy error patterns that could cause you to miss other issues
