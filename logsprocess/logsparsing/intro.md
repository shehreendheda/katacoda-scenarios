In this activity, you'll practice creating parsing rules with the Grok Parser in Datadog. Using example Nginx logs, you'll first create parsing rules on your own. Then, you'll use the **Parse my Logs** and **Patterns** features to automatically create parsing rules. Finally, you'll view the Grok Parser in the Nginx Integration Pipeline to see the OOTB solution provided by Datadog.

When you are ready to continue, click **Start Scenario**.
