With the various sources and services supporting your applications, it's important to be able to correlate all data for an application across Datadog for smoother monitoring and troubleshooting workflows.

In this activity, you will use tags assigned to a fictional e-commerce app, Storedog, to explore correlated metric, log, and trace data and to a create targeted alert. You will also create synthetics tests to work with tags as a facet for filters. 

The Storedog app is built using a Spree (Ruby on Rails) framework along with Flask (Python) microservices for handling coupon codes and ad services and is brought online using docker container images.
