As part of the training environment, a Datadog workshop test account was created for you to use.
This account will be used for our experiments.

1. Open the <a href="https://app.datadoghq.com/account/login" target="_datadog">Datadog account log in page</a>. **If this sends you to a previous logged in Datadog account, you'll need to Log Out first**.

2. To log in, use the credentials that show up when you type `creds`{{execute T1}} in the terminal.

3. Once you have successfully logged in to the Datadog workshop test account, navigate to the
<a href="https://app.datadoghq.com/apm/docs?architecture=container-based&collection=Same%20host&environment=docker&language=java" target="_datadog">APM Getting started page</a>.

Proceed to the next step to continue adding Datadog APM and Continuous Profiling to `movies-api-java`.
