You decide to investigate and troubleshoot application perfomance issues using Application Performance Monitoring (APM) and Continuour Profiling in Datadog.

APM and the Continuous Profiler give deep visibility into your applications with out-of-the-box performance dashboards for web services, queues, and databases to monitor requests, errors, and latency. 



In Datadog, distributed traces can be seamlessly correlated to browser sessions, logs, profiles, synthetic checks, network, processes, and infrastructure metrics across hosts, containers, proxies, and serverless functions. You can navigate directly from investigating a slow trace to identifying the specific line of code causing performance bottlenecks with code hotspots.
