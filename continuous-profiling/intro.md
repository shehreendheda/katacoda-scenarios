# Diagnose and Optimize CPU performance with Continuous Profiling

![cpexample](assets/cpexample.png)

The Continuous Profiler in Datadog is an always-on, production code profiler that enables you to analyze code-level performance across your entire environment, with minimal overhead. Profiles reveal which functions (or lines of code) consume the most resources, such as CPU and memory. With this information, you can optimize your code to reduce both your end-user latency and cloud provider costs.

Continuous Profiling in Datadog allows you to visualize all your stack traces in one place, discover bottlenecks in your code at a glance, zero in on profiles using tags, correlate profiles and distributed traces seamlessly, get actionable insights for performance improvements, and track long-term performance trends.Continuous Profiling complements distributed tracing, runtime metrics, log analytics, Synthetic Monitoring, and Real User Monitoring in your application developerâ€™s toolkit to make troubleshooting performance issues even faster and simpler. 

In this scenario, you will explore how to diagnose production CPU performance problems in a java application.

Prerequisites: Familiarity with APM in Datadog and basic knowledge of Java programming langauge.
