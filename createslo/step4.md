Now that youâ€™ve created a monitor for the p99 latency of viewing the home page, you can create the SLO to track that, 99% of time, the p99 latency of viewing the home page should be lower than 6 seconds.

1. In <a href="https://app.datadoghq.com/slo" target="_datadog">**Monitor** > **Service Level Objectives** in Datadog</a>, click **New SLO**. 
2. Under **Define the source**, select **Monitor Based**, then select the monitor you created from the menu.
3. Under **Set your targets**, click **Set Target +** and set **Target:** to **99%** and **Time Window:** to **7 Days**.
4. Under **Add names and tags**, enter **Home Page Latency** for **Name:** and **99% of time, the p99 latency of viewing the home page should be lower than 6 seconds** for **Description**.
5. Click **Save**.
6. In the **Service Level Objectives** list, click the SLO you just created to view the details, status and history.

Because your app was just instrumented with Datadog and your monitor is new, more metrics need to be collected before the SLO status and history provide insightful information about the SLO. If the app ran for 7 days or more, the history bar would be a solid.
