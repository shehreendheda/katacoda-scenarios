Before creating SLIs for SLOs, you can explore and search the metrics available for the app in Metrics, Notebooks, Monitors, Dashboards, and APM in Datadog. 

Letâ€™s look at the metrics that can be used to create SLIs for viewing the homepage.

1. In <a href="https://app.datadoghq.com/apm/services" target="_datadog">**APM** > **Services**</a> in Datadog, click the **storefrontend** service.
2. Scroll down to the list of **Endpoints** and click **Spree::HomeController#index**.
3. Scroll through and explore the data for **Spree::HomeController#index**.
4. Expand the graphs to see which metrics are visualized in each graph. <p> Note the metrics listed for the **Latency** graph. The **trace.rack.request.duration.by.resource_service.99p** metric represents the p99 latency for viewing the home page. *Is this metric relevant to the SLI?*

You can continue to explore and search the different services and metrics for the app. 

In the next step, you will create a monitor for the SLI for latency of viewing the app home page.
