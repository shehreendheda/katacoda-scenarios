Now, let's create the monitor for the SLI.

1. In <a href="https://app.datadoghq.com/monitors#/create" target="_datadog">**Monitor** > **New Monitor**</a> in Datadog, select the **APM** monitor.

2. Expand **Select monitor scope** and select `APM Metrics`. Set **Service:** to `storefrontend`, and **Resource:** to `spree::homecontroller_index`.

3. Expand **Set alert conditions** and select `Threshold Alert`. Set the alert criteria to **Alert when the** `p99 latency` **is** `above` `6` **over the last** `5 minutes`.

4. Leave **Say whatâ€™s happening** and **Notify your team** as is.

5. Click **Save**.

6. In the **Manage Monitors** list, click the monitor that you just created to view its details.

(To learn more about APM Monitors, you can view the <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/monitor_types/apm/?tab=apmmetrics#overview" target="_blank">Datadog Documentation</a>.)

The monitor you created will be used to create the Monitor Based SLO.
