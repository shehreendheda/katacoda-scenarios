Congratulations! You've created a user-defined function **checksumsq()** that returns the sum of squares of integers in a list and checks whether the sum is even or odd.

As you saw in the scenario, you can define a complex function by starting with a simple version of it and building it up from there. 

Before you go, some food for thought: We made the assumption that any argument passed into the function is a list. We can add a conditional to the function to check whether the argument actually is list.
