The `store-frontend` service has a Ruby-on-Rails framework. The first step for instrumentation is to install the required Ruby tracing and log libraries. Next, an initializer file is added to enable Rails instrumentation, followed by a configuration file to ship logs to Datadog in JSON format so that Datadog can filter the logs based on special parameters. Finally, the docker-compose.yml is updated to log injection and App Analytics for the frontend service. 

The store-frontend service has been instrumented for you, but you will update the docker-compose.yml. Let's first go through the instrumentation.

1. Click `store-frontend/Gemfile`{{open}} to view the Gemfile for the store-frontend. The Gemfile installs the required tracing and log collection libraries.<p> **Line 46** installs the `ddtrace` Gem, which is <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/setup/ruby/" target="_blank">Datadogâ€™s tracing client for Ruby</a>. The `ddtrace` library traces requests as they flow across web servers, databases, and microservices so that developers have high visibility into bottlenecks and troublesome requests. <p>**Line 48** installs the `logging-rails` Gem, which is a railtie for integrating the Ruby logging framework into the Rails application. To learn more, view the <a href="https://github.com/TwP/logging-rails" target="_blank">logging-rails</a> documentation. <p>**Line 49** installs the `lograge` Gem to send logs to Datadog. To learn more, view the <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/log_collection/ruby/#setup" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails log collection</a> documentation.

2. Click `store-frontend/config/initializers/datadog.rb`{{open}} to view the initializer file that enables Rails instrumentation. <p>**Line 3** activates autoinstrumentation for Rails, enabling automatic trace collection from the service. You can view the definitions of each option in the <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/setup/ruby/#rails" target="_blank">Tracing Ruby Applications - Integration Instrumentation - Rails</a> documentation. <p>**Line 5** makes sure requests are also instrumented. You can view the definitions of each option in the <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/setup/ruby/#net-http" target="_blank">Tracing Ruby Applications - Integration Instrumentation - Net/HTTP</a> documentation. <p>**Line 6** allows you to update the default behavior of the Datadog tracer. You can view the definitions of each option in the <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/setup/ruby/#advanced-configuration" target="_blank">Tracing Ruby Applications - Advanced Configuration - Tracer Settings</a> documentation.

3. Click `store-frontend/config/environments/development.rb`{{open}} to view the configuration file that converts the logs to the JSON format using **Lines 11-28**. To learn more, view the <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/connect_logs_and_traces/ruby/?tab=lograge#automatic-trace-id-injection" target="_blank">Connecting Ruby Logs and Traces</a> documentation. <p> With the service instrumented and trace collection automatically enabled via the datadog.rb initializer file, you can finish enabling log collection and App Analytics for the service.

4. Click `docker-compose.yml`{{open}}.

6. Under **services** (**Line 2**), view the details for the **frontend** (**Line 36**). <p> Let's add the code for enabling trace and log collection.

7. Copy/paste the following lines in the `environment:` list. <p> Note: Make sure the new lines have the same indent as **Line 38**.
```
      - DATADOG_TRACE_AGENT_HOSTNAME=agent
      - DD_LOGS_INJECTION=true
      - DD_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=true
```{{copy}} <p> `DATADOG_TRACE_AGENT_HOSTNAME=agent` defines the address of the Agent that the tracer submits to (similar to **Line 6** in `store-frontend/config/initializers/datadog.rb`{{open}}). <p> `DD_LOGS_INJECTION=true` enables automatic injection of trace IDs into the logs from the supported logging libraries to correlate traces and logs. <p> `DD_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=true` enables App Analytics for the traces.

8. Copy/paste the following lines below the `volumes` list. <p> Note: Make sure `labels:` has the same indent as `volumes:`. 
```
    labels:
      - com.datadoghq.ad.logs: '[{"source": "ruby", "service": "store-frontend"}]'
```{{copy}} <p> As for the Datadog Agent, these lines allow Datadog to identify the log source for the container and automatically install any corresponding integration. <p> The **frontend** portion of the `docker-compose.yml` should now look like  the screenshot below. <p> ![instrumented-frontend](instrumentapp2/assets/instrumented-frontend.png) <p> With these steps, the Ruby-on-Rails `store-frontend` service is instrumented for APM and Log management with Datadog. <p> Let's restart the docker deployment to apply these changes.

9. Click `docker-compose up -d`{{execute}}. <p> ![restarted-agent-frontend](instrumentapp2/assets/restarted-agent-frontend.png)

Before instrumenting the discounts and advertisements services, let's log in to Datadog to view the traces and logs being collected for the store-frontend service.
