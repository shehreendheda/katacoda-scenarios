For APM in Datadog, you need to enable trace collection by the Datadog agent. To use the added feature of correlating trace and related log data, you will also need to enable log collection.

1. Wait until you see the following files in the editor on the right. <p>![appfiles-allfiles](instrumentapp/assets/appfiles-allfiles.png)
2.  Click `docker-compose.yml`{{open}} to view the file in the editor on the right. <p> The `docker-compose.yml` instruments the Datadog agent and app services for monitoring with Datadog. <p> **Line 7** enables trace collection for the agent using the environment variable `DD_APM_ENABLED=true`. To learn more, view the <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/docker/?tab=standard#optional-collection-agents" target="_blank">Tracing Docker Applications</a> documentation. <p> **Lines 8 and 9** enable log collection from the agent container and from the all other containers using the environment variables `DD_LOGS_ENABLED=true` and `DD_LOGS_CONFIG_CONTAINER_COLLECT_ALL=true`, respectively. To learn more, view the <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/docker/log/?tab=dockercompose#one-step-install-to-collect-all-the-container-logs" target="_blank">Docker Log Collection</a> documentation. <p> **Line 11** assigns the `env:` tag to the application. By assigning this tag, all data coming from the Storedog application is scoped to this environment.

Port `8126` is the default port for tracing.

This **Autodiscovery** feature speeds up the setup process for log collection.

With tracing enabled for the Datadog agent, let's take a look at how the different services of the application are instrumented.
