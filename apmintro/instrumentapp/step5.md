In the terminal on the right, you should see the `The environment is prepared!` message. Let’s take a look at the Storedog app and log into Datadog to view the trace and log data from the app.

1. Click the **storedog** tab on the right to view the Storedog app. <p> Clicking around inside the app, you can see it includes a home page, product pages, advertisements, discounts, and a shopping cart.
2. In a new window/tab, log in to the Datadog account/organization that was created for you by learn.datadoghq.com. <p> To open the correct Datadog organization, you can click **Login Now** in the “Congrats” email you received after you joined the account/organization. <p> Let’s first view the logs coming into the Log Explorer.
3. If you have previously used the **Log Explorer** in the Datadog organization you are working in, navigate to <a href="https://app.datadoghq.com/logs" target="_datadog">**Logs** in Datadog</a> and then move on to the next step. <p>If you are working in a new Datadog organization, you have to first enable Log Management before you can continue. Navigate to <a href="https://app.datadoghq.com/logs" target="_datadog">**Logs**</a>. Click **Get Started**, then click **Start Trial** in the pop-up window. Select **Container**, then select the **docker** tile. Scroll to the bottom and click **Explore your Logs**.
4. In the list of Facets on the left, expand **Services** to view the services from the app that are injecting logs into Datadog. <p>![log-services](instrumentapp/assets/log-services.png)
5. Navigate to <a href="https://app.datadoghq.com/apm/traces" target="_datadog">**APM > Traces** </a> in Datadog to view the list of traces that are coming in. 
6. In the list of Facets on the left, expand **Services** to view the services from the app that are injecting logs into Datadog. <p>![trace-services](instrumentapp/assets/trace-services.png) <p> In addition to `store-frontend`, `advertisements`, and `discounts`, you see 4 other services. <p>`postgres`, which is installed and automatically instrumented for the python-based services, discounts and advertisements (**Line 12** in `discounts-service/requirements.txt`{{open}} and `ads-service/requirements.txt`{{open}}). You can view <a href="http://pypi.datadoghq.com/trace/docs/db_integrations.html#module-ddtrace.contrib.psycopg" target="_blank"> Datadog's Python tracing client</a> for more details. <p> `store-frontend-cache` and `store-frontend-sqlite` because of **Line 3** in `store-frontend/config/initializers/datadog.rb`{{open}} for the `store-frontend` service. <p>`active-record`, which is installed and automatically instrumented to support the ruby-on-rails `store-frontend`(**Line 7** in `store-frontend/config/application.rb`{{open}}). You can view the <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/setup/ruby/#active-record" target="_blank"> Tracing Ruby Application</a> for more details.
7. Click on a trace for the `store-frontend` to view the flame graph and span list. <p>On the right, you will see the list of services in the ruby-shop environment. The color of each span is based on the associated service.  
8. Below the flame graph, click each tab to see the Tags, related Hosts, and related Logs. <p> Under **Logs(#)**, you can see `trace_id:###` tag assigned by Datadog to the trace and the list of logs that are correlated to the trace using the trace_id. (To learn more, view the <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/connect_logs_and_traces/" target="_blank">Connect Logs and Traces</a> documentation.) 
9. Click any of the logs. A new tab will open for the **Log Explorer** and the details for the log. <p>Notice the tag selected in the search field above the lists of logs is the `trace_id` for the specific trace.

As you've seen in this activity, once you've instrumented the varous services of the app, you are able to view the traces and related logs in Datadog. Once in Datadog, you can perform analytics and create dashboards for the data.
