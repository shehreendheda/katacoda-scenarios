The `frontend` service has a Ruby on Rails (Spree) framework. The first step for instrumentation is to install the required Ruby tracing and log collection libraries. Next, an initializer file as added to enable Rails instrumentation. Finally, the docker-compose.yml is updated to enable APM and log for the frontend service.

**Line 43** defines the address of the Agent that the tracer submits to.

**Line 44** enables automatic injection of trace IDs in logs for the supported logging libraries.

**Line 45** enables APP Analytics for the traces.
