The `frontend` service has a Ruby on Rails (Spree) framework. The first step for instrumentation is to install the required Ruby tracing and log collection libraries. Next, an initializer file is added to enable Rails instrumentation. A configuration file is also added to ship logs to Datadog in JSON format so that Datadog can filter the logs based on special parameters. Finally, the docker-compose.yml is updated to enable APM and log for the frontend service.

3. Click `store-frontend/config/environment/development.rb`{{open}}. **Lines 11-28** to view the configuration file that converts the logs to the JSON format. 

4. Click `docker-compose.yml`{{open}}. <p>**Line 43** defines the address of the Agent that the tracer submits to. <p>**Line 44** enables automatic injection of trace IDs in logs for the supported logging libraries. <p>**Line 45** enables APP Analytics for the traces.<p> **Lines 59 and 60** allow Datadog to identify the log source for the container and automatically install the corresponding integration.
