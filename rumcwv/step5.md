Now, let’s walk through a version of Storedog that has some performance issues that are generating some bad CWV scores.
    

2. [Click here](link to RUM overview page with set time duration) to view the RUM overview page for Storedog.

    You can now review Storedog’s Core Web Vital P75 scores, and as you can see: the LCP score is much higher than it should be. If you click the ‘Device Type’ button in the filtering panel at the top of this view –– you also see how this CWV score differed between Mobile and Desktop environments.

3. Navigate to the [Performance Overview Dashboard](link to this app’s Performance Dashboard). Here we can see these CWV scores in the context of the overall UX performance of the app, and immediately correlate it with the P75 average loading time the app had during this duration of time. Still, the CWV scores are not where they should be, yet.
