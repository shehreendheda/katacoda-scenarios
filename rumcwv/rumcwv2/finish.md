Congratulations! You've successfully completed the Introduction to Core Web Vitals using Datadog RUM scenario.

In this scenario, you learned how to set up a fictional e-commerce app for monitoring with Datadog RUM. You also learned how to audit web app performance in the browser and did a deep dive into auditing web app performance in Datadog RUM for simulated user data. You worked with RUM Applications, the Application Overview and Perfomance Overview dashboards, and Views in the Sessions Explorer to investigate and resolve bad app perfomance that was detected based on CWVs insights.

To learn more about Datadog RUM, you can view the <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/real_user_monitoring/" target="_blank">Datadog documentation</a>.
