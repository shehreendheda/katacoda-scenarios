Up to this point, you’ve been able to both track and verify the optimization of the Storedog app’s CWV scores. However, the goal for maintaining this process should not result in having to periodically audit an app manually –– rather, the relevant stakeholders of the app should be alerted automatically if the scores and/or progress indicators they care about fall into an unacceptable range. This is what alert monitoring does for you and is an important step in maintaining a valuable UX for your web app over time. 

Let’s set up RUM Monitor for the LCP of the Storedog app.

1. Return to the [Performance Overview Dashboard](link).

    In the upper right corner of the **Largest Contentful Paint** histogram within the **Core Web Vitals** panel, click the gear icon. An option to create a new monitor will appear. 
    
    Click **Create monitor**. A new browser tab will open with the RUM Monitor editor.

2. Fill in the fields as follows:

    Under **Define the search query**, the fields are already populated based on the dashboard widget you used to create the monitor. You do not need to update these.

    Under **Set alert conditions**, leave the selections `above` and `5 minutes` as is. Enter `4000000000`{{copy}} (4000 ms) for **Alert threshold** and `2500000000`{{copy}} (2500 ms) for **Warning threshold**, which are baseline recommendations for LCP.

    Under **Say what's happening**, enter `LCP is higher than recommended threshold for the Storedog app`{{copy}} for the **Monitor Name**. Enter `LCP is higher than recommended thresholds for the Storedog app. Warning threshold is >2500 ms and Alert threshold is >4000 ms.`{{copy}} for the **Monitor Message**. Enter `application_id:storedog`{{copy}} for the Tags.

    Under **Notify your team**, do not make any changes.

    Click **Save**. You will be redirected to the saved monitor.

4. Above the monitor, click **Manage Monitors**. You will see your monitor in the list.

    In the Facets on the left, select `RUM` under **Type**. Scroll up to see that the only monitor in the list is the one you just created. 
    
5. Wait for the status of the monitor to update.

Now that you have a RUM monitor set up the LCP score performance of the app, anyone indicated in the **Notify your team** field would be alerted to LCP performance that does not meet the criteria in the alert query.
