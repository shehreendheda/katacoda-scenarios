Datadog’s Real User Monitoring (RUM) gives you end-to-end visibility into the real-time activity and experience of individual users in your web and mobile applications. RUM is designed to solve four types of use cases:

- Performance: Track the performance of web pages, mobile application screens, user actions, network requests, and your front-end code.
- Error Management: Monitor the ongoing bugs and issues and track them over time and versions.
- Analytics / Usage: Understand who is using your application (country, device, OS), monitor individual user journeys, and analyze how users interact with your application (most common page visits, clicks, interactions, feature usage).
- Support: Retrieve all of the information related to one user session to troubleshoot an issue (session duration, pages visited, interactions, resources loaded, errors).

In May 2020, Google introduced Core Web Vitals (CWVs), a set of three metrics that serve as the gold standard for monitoring a site’s UX performance. These metrics, which focus on load performance, interactivity, and visual stability, simplify UX metric collection by signaling which frontend performance indicators matter the most.

This scenario will provide an overview of monitoring CWVs for a fictional e-commerce app, Storedog, using Datadog RUM. You will see where CWVs are tracked on the frontend, to what they imply on the backend, and how to use RUM to gather and analyze CWVs insights to create and foster an optimized user experience for web applications. 

Primary Audience: The primary audience for this scenario is frontend engineers and SREs who will use Datadog to understand how to measure, track, and use CWVs to optimize the front end performance of Single Page Apps (SPAs) that are both in development and in production. Students are expected to have familiarity with the Datadog platform, The DOM, JavaScript, and Node.js, as well as a basic familiarity with component driven frameworks (eg. React, Angular, etc).
